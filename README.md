# Advent Of Code

This repository contains my solutions to every AdventOfCode competition between 2016 and 2021, implemented in C++.
Note that I also solved the 2015 edition, but I did not save my code that year.

Some of the solutions are not optimized, but no problem should take more than 30 seconds max on a laptop to be solved.

The `Day0` folder contains utilities to setup a base code for new days, as well as tools to compile or test each day of a given year.
